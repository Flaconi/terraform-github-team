This module ships with a root module that allows you to create a list of teams (including child teams) and their corresponding association.
You can however also just use the bundled sub-modules and wrap your own root module around.


## Important

This module will not work when using `terraform apply -parallelism=1`. It must be run in parallel (as is by default).


## Features

This module provides the following features without having to re-create teams in a single run as it is able to handle parent/child dependencies automatically:

* Create stand-alone teams
* Create nested teams
* Add member association
* Allows for moving teams up/down a level teams
* Allow for changing team names


## Safe usage

The following has been extensively tested with this module

1. terraform apply from scratch
2. terraform destroy
3. terraform apply with a stand-alone team renamed
4. terraform apply with a parent team renamed team renamed
5. terraform apply with moving a stand-alone team one level up
6. terraform apply with moving a team (which contains childs) one level up


## Example `terraform.tfvars`

```hcl
token = "<REDACTED>"
owner = "<ORGANIZATION-NAME>"

teams = [
  {
    ident       = "devops"   # The 'ident' is a unique ident to allow restructuring without team re-creation
    name        = "DevOps"
    description = "The DevOps Team"
    privacy     = "closed"
    parent_name = null
    members     = ["cytopia"]
  },
  {
    ident       = "engineering"
    name        = "Engineering"
    description = "The Engineering Team"
    privacy     = "closed"
    parent_name = null
    members     = ["cytopia"]
  },
  {
    ident       = "frontend"
    name        = "Frontend"
    description = "Team Frontend"
    privacy     = "closed"
    parent_name = "Engineering"
    members     = []
  },
  {
    ident       = "backend"
    name        = "Backend"
    description = "Team Backend"
    privacy     = "closed"
    parent_name = "Engineering"
    members     = []
  },
```
